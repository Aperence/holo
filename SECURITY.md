# Security Policy

We take the security of Holo very seriously. This document outlines our security policy and procedures for reporting vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

The Holo project follows the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) versioning scheme. The latest major release is the only one that is actively maintained.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Your help in keeping Holo Routing secure is greatly appreciated! If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, we kindly ask you to report it to us privately.

**Please DO NOT report vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues or pull requests.**

Instead, please use **GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature**:

1. Navigate to our dedicated [report a vulnerability page](https://github.com/holo-routing/holo/security/advisories/new).
2. Follow the instructions to submit your report.

You can find more detailed information about this private reporting process on GitHub's official documentation: [Privately reporting a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

### Our Process After You Report

Once you submit a report:

* Our team will triage your submission promptly to understand the nature and severity of the vulnerability.
* We'll keep you informed about our progress. We might ask for more details or steps to reproduce the issue within the private advisory comments.
* We commit to working with you to understand and resolve the vulnerability.
* If your reported vulnerability leads to a security fix, we'll gladly credit you in the security advisory once it's publicly disclosed, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.
